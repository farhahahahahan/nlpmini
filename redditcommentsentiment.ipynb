I keep ranting about Roger Penrose's views on human consciousness and what it means for human value v. ai, which I won't go into here. The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

I believe that possibly spiking neural networks could be one path to fixing the adaptability problem but not a complete one.. it's likely that the first conscious AI will need to be purpose built from several pieces/models.. a core consciousness loop/model that runs persistently and likely other specialized models for specific tasks like vision processing, audio processing, audio output, possibly motor control, some type of vector database for long term memory, etc.. that are called/processed from the main loop.. it's possible that even a sleep like state will be necessary to incorporate new data regularly..  this is very much how humans are believed to work as we definitely have specialized areas of the brain for specific functions.. while one large model may work I think using ourselves as a template is a good starting point... problem is, we don't fully understand how we work..\n",

            "We know there is a strong emotional network in all mammalian brains, so we include emotional intelligence as a metric in their consciousness. Emotional intelligence gets more robust, theoretically, depending on how developed the “emotional processing” brain regions are in a species. They can have more complex emotional opinions on things, whether instinctually or consciously.\n",
            "We also know that the development of some generalizing cortices like the prefrontal cortex improves ALL types of intelligence in a species — and the cortices are the region of the brain where conscious experience primarily occurs. This is corroborated by behavioral testing.\n",
            "So research tends to conclude that the physical structure of a brain provides hints as to the capabilities of consciousness. This is obviously human-centric, but it makes sense since humans are the best possible test subjects in the animal kingdom. Furthermore, humans DO share a lot of their conscious experience with animals — especially mammals — so the assumption isn’t unfounded. In these cases, the complexity of a biological neural network correlates with intelligence which correlates stepwise to consciousness. \n",
            "So a lot of people assume that intelligence and consciousness are related, but there’s no robust way of studying that in AI yet because so much of our past studies have been conducted into biological neural networks. In truth, there is no structure of any kind of studying artificial consciousness like there is for biological. When processing power increases in a brain, we know what experiences are effected depending on the relative size/connectivity of each region. \n",
            "In AI, it’s a crapshoot because so much of the code is purpose-driven or are, physically, less complex connectron networks.

It might not happen concurrent with reaching human level intelligence, and we might not all agree when AIs are conscious or when they reach human-level intelligence. Yann Le Cun has been arguing GPT4 does not yet approach cat-level (or dog-level) cognition, for instance, whereas I think this claim is silly. Reaching consciousness and reaching human-level intelligence are distinctly different milestones, which could be pursued separately.\n",
            "Personally, I think it is likely (not inevitable) that something like consciousness will be necessary for highly intelligent AIs that have realtime goals and executive function.

It is very likely that realtime interactive intelligence in advanced AIs will require an attention-management system and representation of internal thought processes to protect against combinatorial explosion. It's also very likely that  consciousness itself is an attention management schema (see Michael Graziano's work).\n",

This assumption, that human-level intelligence will naturally lead to some form of consciousness, is grounded in an anthropocentric viewpoint.\n",
            "In Western thought, from Cartesian dualism to existentialism, consciousness is often tied to self-awareness, intentionality, and subjectivity. In contrast, Eastern philosophies emphasize an interconnected, collective form of consciousness. Modern theories like Integrated Information Theory offer another angle, suggesting that the ability to process and integrate complex information may be a hallmark of consciousness. These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",
            "Applying these human-centric theories to AI, which lacks biological and evolutionary substrates, is problematic. Descartes would question an AI's capability to doubt or think autonomously. Existentialism, rooted in human emotions and desires, wouldn't easily map onto an AI's operational framework. Eastern philosophies would ponder whether AI could be part of the interconnected web of consciousness or merely an imitator.\n",
            "Thus, the pursuit of understanding AI consciousness necessitates a broader inquiry: Is the question of AI consciousness actually revealing the inadequacies in our own definitions and understanding of consciousness itself? As we venture deeper into the realm of AI, we might find that it serves less as a mirror reflecting human-like consciousness and more as a prism—refracting our ideas into new conceptual spaces that force us to reevaluate the very frameworks we use to understand ourselves and the world around us. This reframing could be the keystone that redirects our exploration from mere technological possibilities to a fuller, more nuanced understanding of consciousness in all its manifestations.\n",

The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase.

As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

            "I disagree. You need to understand more about how AI works to appreciate that it's radically different than the way our brains work. When you respond to a question, you conceive the idea of what you want to convey and only after that do you start putting it into words. You may evolve and refine that idea second-to-second while you're speaking, but you do start with a \"concept/thought/idea\". You don't start just spitting out words based on the proxmity of tokens in the question you were asked. That's what LLMs do. There's no model of the universe and deductive reasoning. The difference is very technical and can't fit well into a Reddit response. It's all based on statistical math, tokenization, word vectors, transformers, matrices with 1000s of dimensions in a neural network, the feed-forward and attention-finding mechanisms - and a number of other abstractions. All based on the grammar and proximity of words people have spoken in the past. You don't have to accept all that at face value but if you dig in I'm sure you'd find that. I run local LLMs in my home lab and submit prompts with a bunch of parameters like temperature, max generated tokens, context length, top_k, top_p, repeat_last_n, repeat_penalty etc. all carefully tuned to feed the get-next-word algorithm that really does just find a word at a time and even when the last word is delivered, it doesn't know what it just said other than for storage/logging/etc. You have to be a software engineer (which I've been since the '70s) to fully appreciate the details, but this is a good paper that's pretty understandable by most anybody without going too far down in the weeds.

But this can only be achieved on an individual level as the subconscious psyche that needs to be tamed is not collective thoughts by humans (Carl Jung does a good job discussing collective human psychology in his book Practice of Psychotherapy). Collective human consciousness leads to collective human suffering due to the inconsistent views humans have of consciousness (ie views of consciousness rooted in religion, politics, societal views, cultural views, etc.)\n",

Emotional intelligence gets more robust, theoretically, depending on how developed the “emotional processing” brain regions are in a species. They can have more complex emotional opinions on things, whether instinctually or consciously.\n",

            "So research tends to conclude that the physical structure of a brain provides hints as to the capabilities of consciousness. This is obviously human-centric, but it makes sense since humans are the best possible test subjects in the animal kingdom. Furthermore, humans DO share a lot of their conscious experience with animals — especially mammals — so the assumption isn’t unfounded. In these cases, the complexity of a biological neural network correlates with intelligence which correlates stepwise to consciousness. \n",
            "So a lot of people assume that intelligence and consciousness are related, but there’s no robust way of studying that in AI yet because so much of our past studies have been conducted into biological neural networks.

When processing power increases in a brain, we know what experiences are effected depending on the relative size/connectivity of each region. \n",

            "In Western thought, from Cartesian dualism to existentialism, consciousness is often tied to self-awareness, intentionality, and subjectivity. In contrast, Eastern philosophies emphasize an interconnected, collective form of consciousness. Modern theories like Integrated Information Theory offer another angle, suggesting that the ability to process and integrate complex information may be a hallmark of consciousness. These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",
            "Applying these human-centric theories to AI, which lacks biological and evolutionary substrates, is problematic. Descartes would question an AI's capability to doubt or think autonomously. Existentialism, rooted in human emotions and desires, wouldn't easily map onto an AI's operational framework. Eastern philosophies would ponder whether AI could be part of the interconnected web of consciousness or merely an imitator.\n",

As we venture deeper into the realm of AI, we might find that it serves less as a mirror reflecting human-like consciousness and more as a prism—refracting our ideas into new conceptual spaces that force us to reevaluate the very frameworks we use to understand ourselves and the world around us.

The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

Besides, we can make universal thinking machines with consciousness for the low price of reproduction. Far in the future was may build a general AI, however besides a scientific endeavor - it's pointless. What is better is to take tasks that are created by our general intelligence and optimize them to specific problems - no consciousness required. Work to amplified human intelligence rather than try to replace it with a poor facsimile. AI is a tool - we are not creating minds. Again, much of the hype is new age religion in the cloak of tech optimism. How well did NFTs and digital currency do to change the world forever? AI is the new hype vector - but it's just new tools.

They are fed terabytes of text written by humans, and are as a result capable of mimicking human writing to an incredibly high degree of precision. This degree of “precision” correlates positively with both the number of parameters (or weights) the model utilises as well as the number of tokens the model is trained on.\n",

With such a massive leap in model size and quality, it’s easy to imagine that the new hypothetical model is far better at modelling human behaviour than any current model is.

This means that even from an information theory perspective, there’s nothing stopping you from running a physics simulation using the logic dictated by the model weights present within an LLM, further implying you could in theory contain all information relevant to a human brain in the context window, then have the LLM predict the next brain state based on physical laws alone.\n",

You don't start just spitting out words based on the proxmity of tokens in the question you were asked. That's what LLMs do. There's no model of the universe and deductive reasoning.

It's all based on statistical math, tokenization, word vectors, transformers, matrices with 1000s of dimensions in a neural network, the feed-forward and attention-finding mechanisms - and a number of other abstractions.

It is unknown how this being in or near this state affects intelligence, creativity and behavior, but it certainly should have some kind of effect.\n",

In order to go beyond that, it will need something equivalent to how the DMN operates in the \"cortical integration\" paper, and as you can see, that cortical integration goes way beyond anything dreamt of in mainstream neuroscience.\n",

I keep ranting about Roger Penrose's views on human consciousness and what it means for human value v. ai, which I won't go into here. The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

They are fed terabytes of text written by humans, and are as a result capable of mimicking human writing to an incredibly high degree of precision. This degree of “precision” correlates positively with both the number of parameters (or weights) the model utilises as well as the number of tokens the model is trained on.\n",

This means that even from an information theory perspective, there’s nothing stopping you from running a physics simulation using the logic dictated by the model weights present within an LLM, further implying you could in theory contain all information relevant to a human brain in the context window, then have the LLM predict the next brain state based on physical laws alone.\n",

You don't start just spitting out words based on the proxmity of tokens in the question you were asked. That's what LLMs do. There's no model of the universe and deductive reasoning. The difference is very technical and can't fit well into a Reddit response. It's all based on statistical math, tokenization, word vectors, transformers, matrices with 1000s of dimensions in a neural network, the feed-forward and attention-finding mechanisms - and a number of other abstractions.

A person in this state is said to be free from any kind of psychological stress that might interfere with normal functioning in life, whether athletic or intellectually based... or at least, such stresses are reduced sufficiently that this \"experience\" of featureless self continues 24/7.\n",
