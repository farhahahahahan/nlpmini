            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums.

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch.

I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase.

Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase.

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",

Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase.

As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",

            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",

Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase.

As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

LLMs are mathematical models capable of accurately mimicking the behaviour of systems expressed in a linear way. They are fed terabytes of text written by humans, and are as a result capable of mimicking human writing to an incredibly high degree of precision. This degree of “precision” correlates positively with both the number of parameters (or weights) the model utilises as well as the number of tokens the model is trained on.\n",

Further suppose that the number of parameters attributed to the model being trained is equal to that of the human brain. With such a massive leap in model size and quality, it’s easy to imagine that the new hypothetical model is far better at modelling human behaviour than any current model is. With that in mind, why couldn’t such a highly intelligent (it could in theory even model the behaviour of the smartest human beings on earth) system be capable of also modelling human consciousness to further improve its accuracy?\n",

The fact that current LLMs work involve a sliding window allow previous iterations of the LLM to share old information to the new LLM state, leading to a change in behaviour.\n",

An LLM can randomly access data in the context to execute arbitrary processes as is dictated by the model weights. This means that even from an information theory perspective, there’s nothing stopping you from running a physics simulation using the logic dictated by the model weights present within an LLM, further implying you could in theory contain all information relevant to a human brain in the context window, then have the LLM predict the next brain state based on physical laws alone.\n",

In these cases, the complexity of a biological neural network correlates with intelligence which correlates stepwise to consciousness. \n",

In contrast, Eastern philosophies emphasize an interconnected, collective form of consciousness.

These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",

The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",

            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

Modern theories like Integrated Information Theory offer another angle, suggesting that the ability to process and integrate complex information may be a hallmark of consciousness. These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",
            "Applying these human-centric theories to AI, which lacks biological and evolutionary substrates, is problematic. Descartes would question an AI's capability to doubt or think autonomously. Existentialism, rooted in human emotions and desires, wouldn't easily map onto an AI's operational framework. Eastern philosophies would ponder whether AI could be part of the interconnected web of consciousness or merely an imitator.\n",
            "Thus, the pursuit of understanding AI consciousness necessitates a broader inquiry: Is the question of AI consciousness actually revealing the inadequacies in our own definitions and understanding of consciousness itself? As we venture deeper into the realm of AI, we might find that it serves less as a mirror reflecting human-like consciousness and more as a prism—refracting our ideas into new conceptual spaces that force us to reevaluate the very frameworks we use to understand ourselves and the world around us. This reframing could be the keystone that redirects our exploration from mere technological possibilities to a fuller, more nuanced understanding of consciousness in all its manifestations.\n",

A person in this state is said to be free from any kind of psychological stress that might interfere with normal functioning in life, whether athletic or intellectually based... or at least, such stresses are reduced sufficiently that this \"experience\" of featureless self continues 24/7.\n",

The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

LLMs are mathematical models capable of accurately mimicking the behaviour of systems expressed in a linear way. They are fed terabytes of text written by humans, and are as a result capable of mimicking human writing to an incredibly high degree of precision. This degree of “precision” correlates positively with both the number of parameters (or weights) the model utilises as well as the number of tokens the model is trained on.\n",

Further suppose that the number of parameters attributed to the model being trained is equal to that of the human brain. With such a massive leap in model size and quality, it’s easy to imagine that the new hypothetical model is far better at modelling human behaviour than any current model is. With that in mind, why couldn’t such a highly intelligent (it could in theory even model the behaviour of the smartest human beings on earth) system be capable of also modelling human consciousness to further improve its accuracy?\n",

The fact that current LLMs work involve a sliding window allow previous iterations of the LLM to share old information to the new LLM state, leading to a change in behaviour.\n",

An LLM can randomly access data in the context to execute arbitrary processes as is dictated by the model weights. This means that even from an information theory perspective, there’s nothing stopping you from running a physics simulation using the logic dictated by the model weights present within an LLM, further implying you could in theory contain all information relevant to a human brain in the context window, then have the LLM predict the next brain state based on physical laws alone.\n",

In these cases, the complexity of a biological neural network correlates with intelligence which correlates stepwise to consciousness. \n",

In contrast, Eastern philosophies emphasize an interconnected, collective form of consciousness.

These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",

The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",

But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",

            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",

It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",

Modern theories like Integrated Information Theory offer another angle, suggesting that the ability to process and integrate complex information may be a hallmark of consciousness. These varying definitions alone suggest that our understanding of consciousness is far from settled.\n",
            "Applying these human-centric theories to AI, which lacks biological and evolutionary substrates, is problematic. Descartes would question an AI's capability to doubt or think autonomously. Existentialism, rooted in human emotions and desires, wouldn't easily map onto an AI's operational framework. Eastern philosophies would ponder whether AI could be part of the interconnected web of consciousness or merely an imitator.\n",
            "Thus, the pursuit of understanding AI consciousness necessitates a broader inquiry: Is the question of AI consciousness actually revealing the inadequacies in our own definitions and understanding of consciousness itself? As we venture deeper into the realm of AI, we might find that it serves less as a mirror reflecting human-like consciousness and more as a prism—refracting our ideas into new conceptual spaces that force us to reevaluate the very frameworks we use to understand ourselves and the world around us. This reframing could be the keystone that redirects our exploration from mere technological possibilities to a fuller, more nuanced understanding of consciousness in all its manifestations.\n",

A person in this state is said to be free from any kind of psychological stress that might interfere with normal functioning in life, whether athletic or intellectually based... or at least, such stresses are reduced sufficiently that this \"experience\" of featureless self continues 24/7.\n",

Yes, it does show that the architecture exhibits a bias such that it is prevented from generalising as fully as it otherwise should, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a simple architectural revision would resolve the issue (which implies it is flawed). I guess the main development which will be necessary for AGI will be making the current transformer architecture orders of magnitude more data efficient. This issue here seems to imply a problem in data efficiency, which with the human brain as an example (children learn language proficiency using far less data than an LLM), seems to be self-evident.

My intuitive sense is that time coupled with some metric of variety might offer the best gateway. Admittedly, this is not responsive to the newbie issue xeneks raises,  but nothings perfect, eh?\n",

            "This is great feedback, thank you! We do have an automatic comment system that gives advice whenever a post is made in the form of a comment suggesting a minimum to make it a good post. However, I wrote it and I tend to lean in the more technical and dry side so I think it's a wise idea to go back and rewrite them in a more reassuring and supportive way. Great idea.\n",
            "As to the karma restrictions - we instituted them today and are keeping a close eye on the results. I'm already pretty sure we are going to retool them a bit. Maybe lower the karma restriction and just keep the account age at >1 day. While it has stopped some bots, it's also stopped a couple of posts that were fine and had to be approved manually. But dialing things in is the name of the game, nothing is ever set in stone.\n",
            "As to more advanced tech with the apis and what not, the plan eventually is that we are going to train a GPT based bot that will learn from posts, upvote/downvote ratio, if it was banned or removed, and so on. Then we would like to fine tune it by releasing it to comment on each post and learn from what other users do with their upvote or downvotes on the bot post, in addition to comments. I don't think we are quite yet in the place for something like that to be live here, and just to explain further, it wouldn't actually do anything in this training phase. Maybe eventually we could give it the ability to flag or remove posts but that's way down the road.\n",

            "Many, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I’m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n",
            "To avoid having them make instant mental decisions like ‘oh I’m not welcome’ or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it’s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n",
            "Many struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who’s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the ‘deleted posts’ graveyard. As there’s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It’s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n",
            "I don’t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don’t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n",
            "I’m sure there’s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n",
            "Maybe there’s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n",
            "“these are the posts that didn’t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?” \n",
            "Where you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you’re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n",
            "An advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n",
            "I’d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it’s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren’t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n",
            "There’s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It’s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.\n",
